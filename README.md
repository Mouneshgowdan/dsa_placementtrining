# ðŸš€ DSA for Placements

This repository contains important **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts, notes, and solved problems for **coding interviews and campus placements**.  
It covers Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Heaps, Recursion, Dynamic Programming, and Backtracking.  

The goal of this repo is to help students:  
- Build strong **problem-solving skills**  
- Practice **standard interview problems**  
- Revise DSA concepts quickly before placements
